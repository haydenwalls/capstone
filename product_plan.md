# Personal Learning Goals

  * Leverage experience with the ReactJS framework to investigate native mobile development via React Native

  * Explore how to best enable users to create intuitive, beautiful multimodal sensory experiences and in turn apply similar methods to the platform as a whole so users can easily navigate the constantly shifting tides of e-motion

  * Utilize a document-based NoSQL database (Firebase Cloud Firestore) and Firebase Cloud Functions to build a cloud-centric, serverless backend / API

  * Develop a deeper understanding of UX and interaction design than previous Ada projects have allowed for (in practice this means designing simple but powerful flows that allow for highly complex and varied emergent user-generated phenomena)



# Problem Statement

  An avante-garde culture focused on the curation of content according to ultra-niche themes, or "aesthetics", has organically emerged on platforms such as Tubmlr, Instagram, and even Facebook, but none of these apps are intentionally designed with this style of collecting and curating in mind. We propose a content-sharing app organized around user-defined "moods" and data-visualization features that allow one to experience their moods over time in novel, interactive ways.



# Market Research

  ## Competition:

  *Url Based*:
    
  * Tumblr
   
  * Pinterest
  
  * Instagram
  
  * Facebook

  *Irl Based*:
    
  * Collages
    
  * Mood Boards
    
  * Shouting re: your emotions in the town square

  ## Failures of Competition:

  The previously mentioned "aesthetic culture" seems to have predominately arisen on the Tumblr micro-blogging platform, which similarly allowed users to share all types of media on a personal feed/blog that others could view. Sadly, Tumblr has failed almost entirely on both the organizational and collaborative fronts. It allows for basic post tagging, but it is difficult to navigate the site as anything other than a never-ending feed of content. An absurd amount of information is being generated each day by its users, and they have been forced into creating their own old-school link directories of share-worthy items rather than being given a tool to more directly accomplish this. As far as we are aware, there is zero collaborative functionality built into Tumblr.

  Pinterest, as far as our research has shown, is the closest product to ours on a feature-basis, allowing users to easily curate content on various boards they have created that can then be shared with others. The site seems to have gravitated more toward a petty bourgeoisie DIY culture, however, rather than remaining focused on the content itself and the feelings it can evoke. Pinterest culture is a bizarre amalgamation of makeup contouring tutorials, faux-vintage distressed furniture inspo, and Naruto Shippuden confessional posts. We are not exactly sure what is going on here but it doesn't seem very healthy.

  Instagram and Facebook are barely geared for content curation at all, and yet the people are so desperate to categorize and catalogue the Human Experience that they have developed makeshift ways of doing so. One feature in Instagram's favor particularly is the ability to create a post that contains multiple images either via their Layout offshoot app (collaging) or posting multiple images as a gallery. Unfortunately, while Instagram posts may contain text captions and hyperlinks, the platform does not allow users to center posts around anything other than images and short video clips.

  ## Differentiation

  As we have demonstrated, none of the internet's major content-sharing services are intentionally developing features that allow users to generate highly-curated hypermedia experiences. We have also yet to see any service heavily focus on tagging/organizing as well as allowing users to navigate content via anything other than a search bar or tag-cloud. Our app will remain permanently rooted in these conceptual spheres.



# User Personas

  ## Key Target Market Characteristics:

  * Millennial
  * Sad
  * Creative
  * Lonely
  * Extremely Online
  * Ennui
  * Addicted to Media / Stimuli
  * NEET

  These traits point us toward an app design that is flashy, stylish, intuitive, and engaging. The target market desperately wants to create things, but most are too stim-fried and/or depressed to do anything about it. A good alternative then is to collect things that have already been created by others (or at least collect things that can be very easily generated by the user, like decontextualized camera phone photos, obscure lexical detritus, and brief audio field recordings) and arrange them in such a way as to create a conglomerate frequency or mood that is greater than the sum of its parts.



# Technology Selections

  ## Front-End
  * React Native (general UI/app framework)
  * Victory Native (data visualization library)
  * Multiple minor React Native libraries for seemingly trivial tasks that would otherwise require interaction with native code modules

  ## Back-End
  * Node.js
  * Firebase Cloud Functions (API functionality)
  * Firebase Cloud Firestore (database)

  We do not see the need for any additional infrastructure technologies for deployment at this time as the entire backend will hopefully be built on Google's Firebase platform
